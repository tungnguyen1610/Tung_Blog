## Timing Basics

- **Setup Time**: Time input must be stable **before** clock edge.
- **Hold Time**: Time input must be stable **after** clock edge.
- **Aperture Time**: `Setup + Hold` time.
- **Recovery Time**: Time async reset/set must be **inactive before** clock edge.
- **Removal Time**: Time async reset/set must be **inactive after** clock edge.
- **Metastability**: Flip-flops enter unpredictable states if timing is violated.

## Combinational  and Sequetial Logic
Digital systems are built using two fundamental types of logic circuits: **combinational logic** and **sequential logic**. Understanding the distinction is essential for designing reliable hardware systems.

### ðŸ”¹ Combinational Logic

Combinational logic circuits compute outputs purely based on the **current inputs** â€” no memory is involved.

#### âœ… Characteristics:
<ul>
<li> No storage elements </li>
<li>  Output changes immediately when inputs change</li>
<li>  Examples: Gates, Adders, Multiplexers, Decoders </li>
<li> Hazard: Glitches in outputs due to gate delays and improper logic design. </li>
</ul>

#### ðŸ§  Example: 2-to-1 Multiplexer

```verilog
module mux2to1(input a, input b, input sel, output y);
    assign y = sel ? b : a;
endmodule
```
### ðŸ”¹ Sequential Logic
Sequential logic circuits produce outputs based on both current inputs and past history â€” meaning they have memory elements.

#### âœ… Characteristics:
<ul>
<li> Contains storage elements (like flip-flops or latches) </li>
<li> Outputs depend on input and stored state </li>
<li> Can be synchronous (clock-driven) or asynchronous </li>

</ul>

### General model of digital system

## Finite State Machines (FSM)
- Deterministic finite automata define by the following tuple:
  - Initial state
  - Set of accepting states
  - Transition function
  - Output
  - Input alphabet
  
## Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)
