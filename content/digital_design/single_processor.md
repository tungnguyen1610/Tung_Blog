## Introduction

This blog post explores *microarchitecture*â€”the specific arrangement of registers, ALUs, FSMs, memories, and other logic blocks required to implement a processor architecture.

## 1. Architectural State and Instruction Set

- **Architectural state:** 32 general-purpose registers and a program counter (PC)  
- **Instruction set:**  
  - R-type: `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`  
  - Memory instructions: `lw`, `sw`  
  - Branch instruction: `beq`

Example:

## 2. Design Path: Single-Cycle Processor

### 2.1 32-bit Datapath

**State elements:** Program counter, instruction memory, data memory, and register file.

- **Program Counter (PC):** A 32-bit register whose output provides the current instruction address (PC), and whose input (`PC'`) points to the next instruction address.  
- **Instruction Memory:** Has a single read port. Takes the PC as input (instruction address) and outputs a 32-bit instruction.  
- **Register File:** Has two 5-bit read address ports (`Rs`, `Rt`) and one 5-bit write address port (`Rd`). Includes a 32-bit write data input to support immediate addressing.

#### Example: Single-Cycle Datapath for `lw` Instruction

a. Instruction Fetch  
b. Operand Read (Decode)

c. Sign-extend the Immediate

e. Write Back

### 2.2 Control Unit

Control signals are generated based on the **opcode** (bits [31:26]) and **function code** (bits [5:0]) of the instruction.
